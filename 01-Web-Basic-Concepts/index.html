        <li><b>Email Addresses</b>: Hyperlinks can be used to create clickable email addresses. When clicked, these hyperlinks automatically open the user's defaulbt email client, prepopulating the recipient's email address.</li>
        <li><b>Anchors/Bookmarks</b>: Hyperlinks can be used within a web page to create anchors or bookmarks. By clicking on these links, users are directed to a specific section or location within the same web page.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Hyperlinks are typically implemented using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in conjunction with the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element. The &lt;a&gt; element defines the hyperlink, and the "href" attribute specifies the destination URL or the target resource to link to. For example:</p>
      <p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;</p>
      <p>In the above example, "Click here" is the visible text of the hyperlink, and it will navigate the user to "https://www.example.com" when clicked.</p>
      <p>Hyperlinks can be styled and customized using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to change their appearance, such as the color, underlining, and hover effects.</p>
      <p>Hyperlinks play a crucial role in web navigation, allowing users to explore and navigate the interconnected web of resources. They enable seamless access to information, facilitate website navigation, and enhance the user experience on the World Wide Web.</p>

      Q. What is DNS?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a decentralized naming system used on the internet to translate human-readable domain names into the numeric IP addresses required for locating and identifying computer services and devices.</p>
      <p>When you type a domain name like "example.com" into a web browser, the DNS system translates that domain name into the corresponding IP address, such as "192.0.2.1". This translation is necessary because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, which are numerical representations of devices connected to the internet.</p>
      <p>DNS performs two primary functions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Name Resolution</b>: DNS resolves domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. When you enter a domain name in a web browser or any other network application, the DNS system looks up the IP address associated with that domain name and returns it to the application. This allows the application to establish a connection to the desired server or device.</li>
        <li><b>Name Server Management</b>: DNS manages a distributed network of name servers that store and provide information about domain names and their associated IP addresses. Name servers are responsible for storing and serving DNS records, which contain the mappings between domain names and IP addresses. When a DNS lookup is performed, the name servers are queried to retrieve the relevant DNS records.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>DNS operates in a hierarchical structure. At the top level, there are root name servers that contain information about the top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .net, etc. Below the root servers, there are authoritative name servers that handle specific domain names and store the corresponding IP addresses. Additionally, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) often have their own DNS servers to speed up the resolution process for their customers.</p>
      <p>The DNS system also supports other types of records, such as MX records for email servers, CNAME records for aliasing one domain name to another, and TXT records for storing additional information.</p>
      <p>By using DNS, users can access websites and other services on the internet using human-friendly domain names, rather than needing to remember and enter the associated IP addresses. DNS simplifies the process of locating resources and makes the internet more user-friendly.</p>
      <p>Overall, DNS is a critical infrastructure of the internet, facilitating the translation of domain names into IP addresses and enabling seamless communication between devices and services on the global network.</p>

      Q. What is W3C?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium. It is an international community that develops standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web, ensuring its long-term growth, interoperability, and accessibility. The W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and is recognized as the main international standards organization for the web.</p>
      <p>The primary mission of the W3C is to lead the web to its full potential by creating open standards and specifications that promote compatibility and uniformity across different web technologies and platforms. W3C standards are designed to be vendor-neutral, meaning they can be implemented by any organization or software developer.</p>
      <p>The work of the W3C encompasses various aspects of web technologies, including:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>HTML and CSS</b>: The W3C defines and maintains the standards for HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which are fundamental technologies used for creating and styling web pages.</li>
        <li><b>Web Accessibility</b>: W3C plays a crucial role in promoting web accessibility and ensuring that web content and applications are usable by people with disabilities. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of internationally recognized standards developed by the W3C to guide web developers in creating accessible websites.</li>
        <li><b>Web APIs</b>: W3C develops standards for web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow web applications to interact with different devices and services. These APIs enable functionalities such as geolocation, camera access, audio/video playback, and more.</li>
        <li><b>XML and Web Services</b>: The W3C has contributed to the development of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a versatile markup language for structuring and exchanging data. It has also worked on standards for web services, including SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and WSDL (Web Services Description Language).</li>
        <li><b>Privacy and Security</b>: W3C addresses privacy and security concerns on the web by developing standards and guidelines related to secure communication (HTTPS), data protection, and web security protocols.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The work of the W3C involves collaboration among industry experts, researchers, developers, and organizations from around the world. It operates through working groups, which focus on specific areas of web technology, and the resulting standards and specifications are openly available to the public.</p>
      <p>By providing a platform for consensus-based decision-making and collaboration, the W3C helps ensure that the web remains an open, interoperable, and accessible platform for all users. Its efforts in developing and promoting web standards have had a significant impact on the growth and evolution of the World Wide Web.</p>
