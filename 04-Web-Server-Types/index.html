      Q. What are Web Server type?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>There are different types of web servers used to host and serve websites and web applications. These servers provide the infrastructure and functionality required for clients (web browsers) to access and retrieve web content. Here are some commonly used web server types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Apache HTTP Server</b>: The Apache HTTP Server, often referred to as Apache, is one of the most widely used web servers. It is an open-source server software that runs on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Apache is known for its stability, flexibility, and strong community support. It supports multiple modules and extensions, making it highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of applications.</li>
        <li><b>Nginx</b>: Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a popular web server and reverse proxy server. It is known for its high performance, scalability, and efficient handling of concurrent connections. Nginx is often used for serving static content, load balancing, and as a reverse proxy for applications running on other web servers.</li>
        <li><b>Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)</b>: Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is a web server software developed by Microsoft for Windows-based servers. It integrates well with other Microsoft technologies and provides support for ASP.NET, Microsoft's web development framework. IIS offers features like process isolation, security, and extensive management capabilities through the Windows Server environment.</li>
        <li><b>Lighttpd</b>: Lighttpd (pronounced "lighty") is a lightweight and fast web server designed for high-performance environments. It is known for its low memory footprint, efficient handling of static files, and support for FastCGI and other advanced features. Lighttpd is often used for serving static content or as a proxy server.</li>
        <li><b>Node.js</b>: Node.js is not a traditional web server, but rather a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build web servers using JavaScript on the server-side. With frameworks like Express.js, developers can create highly scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js is commonly used for real-time applications and APIs.</li>
        <li><b>Tomcat</b>: Apache Tomcat, or simply Tomcat, is an open-source web server and Java Servlet container. It is used to deploy Java-based web applications that adhere to the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications. Tomcat provides a runtime environment for executing Java web applications and supports Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) features.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These are just a few examples of web server types, and there are many other specialized servers available for specific use cases and programming languages. The choice of a web server depends on factors such as performance requirements, platform compatibility, programming language, community support, and specific features needed for the application or website being hosted.</p>
