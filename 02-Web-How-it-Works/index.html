      Q. Web - How it Works?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources that are accessed over the internet. It works based on a client-server architecture, where clients (web browsers) request and retrieve information from servers that host the web content.</p>
      <p>Here is a high-level overview of how the web works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Client (Web Browser)</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>A user interacts with a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari, installed on their device (computer, smartphone, tablet).</li>
            <li>The web browser acts as a client and is responsible for displaying web content to the user.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>URL and DNS</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The user enters a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the web browser's address bar. The URL is a human-readable web address, like "https://www.example.com", that identifies the desired web resource.</li>
            <li>The web browser sends a Domain Name System (DNS) query to a DNS server to translate the domain name (e.g., "www.example.com") into the corresponding IP address of the web server hosting the requested resource.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>HTTP Request</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Once the IP address is obtained, the web browser initiates an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server identified by the IP address.</li>
            <li>The request includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the requested resource's path (e.g., "/index.html"), and additional headers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Web Server</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The web server, upon receiving the HTTP request, processes it and retrieves the requested resource from its storage.</li>
            <li>The web server generates an HTTP response, which includes the requested resource (e.g., HTML, images, CSS files) and associated metadata, such as status codes, headers, and cookies.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>HTTP Response</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The web server sends the HTTP response back to the web browser via the internet.</li>
            <li>The response contains the requested web content, which may include HTML markup, stylesheets, scripts, and other assets required to render the web page.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Rendering</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The web browser receives the HTTP response and begins parsing and interpreting the response.</li>
            <li>The browser renders the HTML content, applies CSS styles, executes JavaScript code, and combines them to display the final web page to the user.</li>
            <li>The user can interact with the web page, click on hyperlinks, submit forms, or trigger other actions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Additional Requests</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>When a web page includes additional resources, such as images, videos, or external scripts, the web browser sends separate HTTP requests to retrieve those resources.</li>
            <li>This process continues until all resources required to render the web page are retrieved.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>User Interaction</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The user can interact with the displayed web page, follow links to other pages, submit forms, or perform various actions.</li>
            <li>When the user initiates a new request, the process repeats, and the browser sends a new HTTP request to the appropriate web server.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This basic flow illustrates how web browsers communicate with web servers to request and retrieve web content. The web relies on standardized protocols, such as HTTP and DNS, to ensure compatibility and interoperability across different devices, platforms, and web servers.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and the web involves many other technologies, protocols, and standards that contribute to its functionality, security, and performance.</p>
